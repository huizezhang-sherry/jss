```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
options(prompt = 'R> ', continue = '+ ')
```

In the `rticles::jss_article` template, a reference prints out all the author names when it is used for the first time. For example, Let's reference tidyverse: 

tidyverse [@tidyverse]

But the exact same reference works perfectly after the first time:

tidyverse [@tidyverse] 

tidyverse [@tidyverse]

tidyverse [@tidyverse]
